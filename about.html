  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    Hi there,    
    <br>
    <br>
    <p> I'm a Software Engineer in Lagos, Nigeria. I'm passionate about all software engineering, right from the
    processor all the way up, albiet I know little yet. On here, I will post my notes on my learnings and 
    experiments, hopefully someone also benefits from it as I do from many blogs around the internet. </p>
    <br>
    Enjoy :)
